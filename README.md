# 🍛 Hostel Mess Feedback System - Because We Deserve Better Food! 🏠🍽️

## 💡 Why This Exists (A.K.A. The Great Hostel Food Struggle)

Hostel food can be a **rollercoaster**—one day it's decent, and the next, you're questioning your life choices. 🌚 The biggest problem? **Nobody speaks up!**

Mess committee meetings happen, but students rarely say what they actually want. So, we decided to **hack the system** and create a website that:

- ✅ **Lets students rate each food item** (so we know which dishes are a crime against taste buds) 🍲 
- ✅ **Collects suggestions & complaints** anonymously 📢
- ✅ **Analyzes data to show the worst-rated items** so the committee can fix them 📉
- ✅ **Provides an admin panel** to control everything 🛠️
- ✅ **Generates a PDF report** of all the feedback 📄

Basically, this system makes sure our hostel food doesn't make us question our life choices anymore. 🚀
